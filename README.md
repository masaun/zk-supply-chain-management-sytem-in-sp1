# ZK attestation for AI-generated-contents

## Introduction
- As generative AI is evolving, AI-generated contents is also increasing.
  - In the future, AI themself or the owner/creator of AI may hold and manage the IP of AI-generated contents.

- By attesting a ZKP to AI-generated contents (i.e. images), IP of these AI-generated contents can be protected. 
  - In this project, AI-generated images are used as a AI-generated contents.

- SP1 / Succinct would be used for generating/verifying a ZKP, which is attested to AI-generated contents
